And a natural transformations <span class=\"math inline\">\\alpha</span> that corresponds to a monoid morphism <code>m</code> would be just composition of <span class=\"math inline\">f \\in C(x, -)</span> with <code>m</code>. I don't know if it means other than just plain definition of monoid as it appears. If you know please contribute.</p>"},"sha1":"6ce08c7157d20230489067d52de8475b17d8b97f"},"kids":[]}
