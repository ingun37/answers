Suppose also that the overall input to the network of perceptrons has been chosen. We won't need the actual input value, we just need the input to have been fixed. Suppose the weights and biases are such that <span class=\"math inline\">w \\cdot x + b \\neq 0</span> for the input <span class=\"math inline\">x</span> to any particular perceptron in the network. Now replace all the perceptrons in the network by sigmoid neurons, and multiply the weights and biases by a positive constant <span class=\"math inline\">c &gt; 0</span>. Show that in the limit as <span class=\"math inline\">c \\rightarrow \\infty</span> the behaviour of this network of sigmoid neurons is exactly the same as the network of perceptrons.
