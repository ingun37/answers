After all, we\nknow that for all <code>a</code>\n<code>h a * h e = h (a * e) = h a</code> So <code>h e</code> acts like a\nright unit (and, by analogy, as a left unit). The problem is that\n<code>h a</code>, for all <code>a</code> might only cover a sub-monoid\nof the target monoid. There may be a \"true\" unit outside of the image of\n<code>h</code>. Show that an isomorphism between monoids that preserves\nmultiplication must automatically preserve unit.</p>"
