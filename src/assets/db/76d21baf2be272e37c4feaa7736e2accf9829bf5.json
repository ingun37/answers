For example, a system may consist of two components that are connected in parallel as shown in Figure 1.28. When the system's components are connected in parallel, the system works if at least one of the components is functional. The components might also be connected in series as shown in Figure 1.28. When the system's components are connected in series, the system works if all of the components are functional.\n\n![](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/images/chapter1/5-1.png)\n\nFor each of the following systems, find the probability that the system is functional. Assume that component $`k`$ is functional with probability $`P_k`$ independent of other components.\n\n"},"sha1":"76d21baf2be272e37c4feaa7736e2accf9829bf5","title":"29"}}
