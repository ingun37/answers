After all, we know that for all `a`\n`h a * h e = h (a * e) = h a`\nSo `h e` acts like a right unit (and, by analogy, as a left unit). The problem is that `h a`, for all `a` might only cover a sub-monoid of the target monoid. There may be a \"true\" unit outside of the image of `h`. Show that an isomorphism between monoids that preserves multiplication must automatically preserve unit.\n"},"sha1":"e222bf971f83b49d49408586ddef86969809094e","title":"1"}}
