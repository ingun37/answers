Let's proove it.\n\nJust like a cone can't have two lines for one base vertex, $`l`$, as an apex of a cone, can't have both $`m`$ and $`n`$. We have to assign one morphism, to say $`n`$, to some other apex $`a`$.\n\n$`m:l\\rightarrow o`$\n$`n:a\\rightarrow o`$\n\nBeing a limit point, there must be a unique factorizing morphism $`f`$ from $`a`$ to $`l`$ which makes $`n = m \\cdot f`$.\n\n$`\\exists ! f:a \\rightarrow l \\enspace s.t \\enspace n = m \\cdot f`$\n\nBut $`l`$ and $`a`$ is same point that means $`f`$ must be $`id`$ morphism which means $`n = m \\cdot id`$ again which means $`n = m`$\n\n$`l=a`$\n$`\\rightarrow f = id`$\n$`\\rightarrow n = m \\cdot id`$\n$`\\rightarrow n=m`$\n"},"sha1":"f69466586765132e0d0ad1b345d45c2a78221a25"},"kids":[]}
