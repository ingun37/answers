In particular, some words are more frequent in spam emails. Suppose that we have the following information:\n\n* 50%  of emails are spam;\n* 1% of spam emails contain the word \"refinance\";\n* 0.001% of non-spam emails contain the word \"refinance\".\n\nSuppose that an email is checked and found to contain the word \"refinance\".
