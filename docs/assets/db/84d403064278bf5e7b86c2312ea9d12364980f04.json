In the same way we can derive the other way injection $`D(d,Rc) \\rightarrow C(Ld,c)`$ by lifting $`g:d \\rightarrow Rc`$ with $`L`$.  \nLifted $`Lg`$ can be composed with unit $`\\eta`$ and make a morphism $`Lg \\cdot \\eta: Ld \\rightarrow c`$.","q":"\nComplete the proof of equivalence of the two definitions of the adjunction."},"sha1":"84d403064278bf5e7b86c2312ea9d12364980f04","title":"3"}}
